# Safety Policies & Guidelines

Safety is not a feature of the SafeHome Blueprint —  
it is the **core infrastructure** that everything else is built upon.

These policies define the *minimum baseline* for any implementation.  
They protect both **workers** and **clients**, ensuring that trust is a verifiable, measurable standard — not an assumption.

> This document is practical.  
> It’s meant for those building, operating, or regulating a SafeHome-based system.

## 1. Verification & Onboarding

### 1.1 Identity Verification
- **Workers** and **clients** must complete verified identity checks before their first transaction.  
  Acceptable forms include government ID, verified phone, and in-person validation (via partner centers or local admin).
- Optional **trusted reference verification** (for households or workers) may further strengthen credibility.
- Platforms may not allow **anonymous** or **proxy** participation.

### 1.2 Background Screening
- All **workers** must undergo background verification for criminal history, with particular attention to violence, theft, or harassment-related offenses.  
- **Clients** may optionally be verified for safety history — e.g., repeated misconduct reports can trigger preemptive bans.

### 1.3 Gender & Safety Preferences
- Clients may **filter service requests** by gender of worker (e.g., “women-only household” → “women-only workers”).
- Workers may **set preference filters** for households they feel safe entering.
- The system must honor these preferences **without penalty or discrimination**.

## 2. In-Session Conduct Standards

### 2.1 Code of Conduct
- Strict **zero-tolerance** policy for intoxication, verbal abuse, harassment, or physical aggression.
- **Both parties** agree to these terms before confirmation.
- Any violation immediately suspends access pending investigation.

### 2.2 Visibility & Check-In
- Every active service has an **in-app “live status” tracker** or verification timestamp.  
- Workers must be able to **check in and check out** of each session safely.  
- For longer tasks (e.g. installation, home repair), **hourly auto-check prompts** ensure well-being.

### 2.3 Emergency Triggers
- Both parties have access to an **emergency button**, routing instantly to:
  - local emergency number (112 in India),
  - SafeHome’s local coordination team,
  - optional pre-listed emergency contacts.
- Pressing the emergency trigger **suspends payment** until the issue is resolved.

## 3. Response & Escalation

### 3.1 Immediate Actions
When an incident is reported:
1. Suspend both accounts temporarily to prevent contact.  
2. Notify the **Safety Response Officer (SRO)** assigned to the region.  
3. Secure all chat, call, and location logs for investigation.  
4. If physical harm or harassment is alleged, contact law enforcement.

### 3.2 Investigation Timelines
- Initial response within **30 minutes**.
- Full internal review within **72 hours**.
- Written resolution sent to both parties within **5 working days**.

### 3.3 Outcome Transparency
- Confirmed violations → permanent removal, and optional public anonymized disclosure (“x account banned for misconduct”).
- False reports → review for misuse, not retaliation.

## 4. Worker Protection Framework

### 4.1 Safe Transport
- For late-hour services (after 7pm), platforms must:
  - provide or reimburse **safe commute options**,
  - offer **remote monitoring** support if travel is unavoidable.
- Workers have full right to **refuse unsafe bookings** without rating penalty.

### 4.2 Protective Infrastructure
- Ensure workers have **safety kits**, **ID badges**, and optional **body cameras** or wearable trackers.
- Clear protocol if a worker feels unsafe: step out, mark “Unsafe Exit,” system halts the booking instantly.

### 4.3 Health & Rest
- Implement minimum rest times between consecutive bookings (especially for cooking or cleaning staff).
- Disallow forced overtime or client requests extending beyond agreed hours.

---

## 5. Client Protection Framework

### 5.1 Verified Professionals Only
- Every worker profile must clearly show verification status and last background check date.
- Clients must have full visibility into worker certifications, ratings, and past feedback.

### 5.2 Consent & Privacy
- Clients’ home addresses and personal data are encrypted and accessible **only for the duration** of the active booking.
- No worker or admin may store or reuse that data outside the platform.

### 5.3 Service Quality
- Clients are entitled to transparent service pricing, visible refund policies, and a respectful service experience.
- Any unprofessional behavior from workers is investigated under the same zero-tolerance policy.

---

## 6. Community Integrity

### 6.1 Reporting & Feedback
- A single, always-available **Report Misconduct** button.
- Anonymous reporting is allowed but must be verified through secondary review before action.

### 6.2 Restorative Pathways
- If safe and desired by both parties, SafeHome encourages **restorative dialogue** — supervised resolution where harm is acknowledged and redressed.

### 6.3 Public Accountability
- Implementers are encouraged to publish **quarterly transparency reports** summarizing:
  - number of safety incidents,
  - actions taken,
  - and improvements made.

## 7. Enforcement & Penalties

| Violation Type | Action |
|----------------|---------|
| Harassment / Abuse | Permanent ban, legal escalation |
| Drunkenness or substance use during session | Immediate suspension, warning or permanent ban |
| Fake profile / impersonation | Instant removal |
| Data misuse | Permanent ban, legal complaint |
| Unsafe environment / violation of preferences | Penalty and possible suspension |

---

## 8. Legal & Policy Integration

Each local implementation must ensure:
- compliance with national labor, safety, and privacy laws,
- registration of all workers under appropriate legal categories (e.g. gig worker or MSME),
- data sharing agreements with law enforcement for verified emergencies only.

---

## 9. Periodic Review

Safety policies must be **audited annually**, with a review log published openly.  
New features or cities must pass a **safety compliance checklist** before launch.

---

## 10. Human Spirit Clause

SafeHome is built not just to prevent harm, but to **affirm care**.  
Every policy here is a promise — that dignity will not be traded for convenience.

> “Safety is the shape love takes when it becomes responsibility.”
