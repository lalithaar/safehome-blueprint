# License

### **TL;DR - Why This License Exists**

The **Open Impact License** is here to help create **safe**, **fair**, and **accountable** household services — whether you're building a small local project or a larger service. This license lets you **freely use**, **adapt**, and **share** the **SafeHome Blueprint**, as long as you follow the core principles of **safety**, **equality**, **dignity**, and **transparency** for everyone involved, both **workers** and **clients**.

**No one owns this framework** — it's meant for everyone to use, as long as you commit to keeping these values at the heart of your work. The license doesn’t require you to give credit to the original author (Lalitha A R), but you **must** mention the **SafeHome Blueprint** to show where the framework came from and to help ensure accountability.

The goal is **not to intimidate** with legal jargon, but to protect the **vision** and **ethics** behind the blueprint, and make sure that wherever it’s used, people can count on a **safe**, **equal**, and **dignified** experience for both **workers and clients**.

By using this framework, you’re agreeing to help spread the idea that **safety is a baseline, not a luxury**, and that **dignity** and **respect** are the foundation of all good work.


#### 1. Purpose

The **Open Impact License** (OIL) is designed to provide unambiguous terms for the use, modification, and redistribution of the **SafeHome Blueprint** and its associated materials. This License permits **free use** and **modification** of the materials, with the condition that **derivative works** uphold the foundational principles of **safety**, **equality**, **dignity**, and **transparency** for all parties involved. The purpose is to enable the creation of safe, fair, and accountable household service ecosystems while preserving these core ethical principles.

#### 4. Ethical Standards

Any **Derivative Work** or adaptation of the SafeHome Blueprint **must** comply with the following **Ethical Standards**, applying equally to both **workers** and **clients**:

1. **Safety for All Participants**:
   All services, platforms, and implementations based on the SafeHome Blueprint must ensure the **safety of both workers and clients**. This includes verified identities, on-duty protection for all participants, and a **zero-tolerance policy for misconduct**. Both parties should have access to emergency support channels at all times.

2. **Equality and Respect**:
   Both **workers** and **clients** must be treated with **equal respect and dignity** throughout all interactions. The same **code of conduct** must apply to all parties, ensuring violations (e.g., harassment, unsafe behavior) result in immediate removal and reporting.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**:
   Every interaction and service must be **transparent** and **accountable**. This includes providing clear terms of service, maintaining open channels for feedback, and keeping verifiable records of all actions. Both **clients** and **workers** must have means to hold each other accountable for any misconduct or failure to comply with safety protocols.

4. **Fair Compensation and Worker Welfare**:
   **Workers** must receive fair compensation, access to proper safety equipment, and assurance of fair working conditions. Additionally, **client welfare** is a priority, ensuring that all services are rendered professionally, with clear terms for service and resolution in case of dissatisfaction or safety concerns.

5. **Non-Discrimination**:
   **No discrimination** based on **gender**, **race**, **religion**, **disability**, or any other protected characteristic is allowed for either **workers** or **clients**. All participants must be treated equally and fairly.

6. **Public Disclosure**:
   Any **Derivative Work** based on the SafeHome Blueprint **must** clearly disclose that it is based on the SafeHome Blueprint and link to the original License and its terms. **This disclosure is required** to ensure transparency and accountability for the ethical standards applied in any derived systems. **Attribution to the original author (Lalitha A R) is not required**, but the SafeHome Blueprint must be clearly identified as the source for accountability.

#### 4. Enforcement

1. **Breach of License**:
   Any failure to comply with the **Ethical Standards** (Section 4) or the **Prohibited Uses** (Section 5) will result in the **immediate termination** of all rights granted under this License.

2. **Post-Termination Obligations**:
   Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease all use and distribution of the Licensed Material and its Derivative Works and remove any public references to SafeHome or its associated materials.

### 6. Spirit of the License

The **Open Impact License** is not merely a legal framework; it is also a commitment to ensure that services built from the SafeHome Blueprint preserve the **core ethical values** of **dignity**, **safety**, **equality**, and **transparency**. By using or adapting this framework, Licensees agree to uphold these principles and ensure that any derived services are equally safe, transparent, and respectful for both workers and clients.

### Key Clarifications:

1. **Attribution**: It is now explicitly stated that **attribution to the original author** (Lalitha A R) is **not required**. This eliminates any confusion that might arise from the term "attribution" and makes it clear that the focus is on the **SafeHome Blueprint** as the source.

2. **Public Disclosure**: The requirement for **public disclosure** has been clarified: any derived work **must disclose** that it is based on the SafeHome Blueprint and link to the License. This is about **accountability** — making sure that anyone using the framework knows it’s SafeHome, and upholds the ethical standards.

3. **No Contradiction**: There is no contradiction between **not requiring attribution to the author** and **requiring acknowledgment of the SafeHome Blueprint**. The document clearly separates these two concepts:

   * You don’t need to give credit to **Lalitha A R**, but you **must** disclose the **SafeHome Blueprint** as the source to maintain accountability and transparency.
